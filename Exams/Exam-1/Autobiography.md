## Hello Mr. Caner.

when i have freetime, I'm working and when i don't have freetime, I'm working.
If youre asking working about what? I make projects and websites, and I also learn coding, history nd etc.
I love making projects and hardworking.

I'm working at **SnapStack.art** & **R3TForums.com** projects.

I love being alone cause I hate the sound of people.
Not sometimes, everytime I'm making anything but only me.

I am in the electrical and electronics depart. in School.

When I finish the school, I don't wanna goto university if I'm in Turkey, I won't go because I hate education system of turkey

I wanna goto United States of America for education etc.
Why america? cause america supports young entrepreneurs.

I have bro, I'm working with Batin. I'll die with batin, Batin die will me. We're making projects, learning everything.

We said "we would learn everything to each other" cause we wanted to get out of this HOLE.

I Should hard working cause I have fear about failure.
