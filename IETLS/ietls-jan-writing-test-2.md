This is a big problem and big & essential question for judiciary system.
First question is this, Is capital punishment are necessary?

In my opinion and my thinkings, The capital punishment system exists in underdeveloped societies.
If I need to give an example, 
A man can be wrongfully imprisoned. There are many examples of this. If they get death penalty, many people will protest.
But real serious criminals, If they receive the death penalty, This will be their salvation.

Maybe they can be punished indefinitely but the money spent on them comes from the people's taxes.
I've been thinking about it since my childhood, Why they do not work in bad jobs for free?
if we incorporate it into the constitution, The taxes of peoples doesnt using to criminals, then we can imporve education's in school.
Criminals will cover their own expenses.

but if we must use capital punishment, Ceratin crimes don't deserve it.
Like financal criminals, petty theft and etc. But Instead of the death penalty, serious criminals can do hard labor.

Normal people already work in hard labor's, so it doesn't create any human rights issues.

In our country, United States of America, already have Capital Punishment. maybe we need to protest it cause 
So many Seriously criminals isn't getting the punishment they deserve.

And do not forget to, they're devil's. It means, The rapers and pervert's, killer's are devil and they don't deserve Capital Pnishment, they deserve work in hard labor. The death is salvation for devil's.
