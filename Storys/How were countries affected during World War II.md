# How were countries affected during World War II?

> World War Two

Germany, The first main character in our story.
The germany started the war. Suffered massive destruction from Allied bombings;
Cities were ruined, millions killed, and the country was divided into East and West Germany
after 1945.

What about our second country?
The **Soviet Union** now known as **Russia**.
Bore the heaviest losses (about 27 million people dead.); widespread destruction of cities, farmland and indiustry, bug emegred as a global superpower.

France? He was quickly defeated.
And It remained under German occupation until 1944.
The people rose up in resistance and protest.
But It suffered severe damage regardless
I rest my case.
